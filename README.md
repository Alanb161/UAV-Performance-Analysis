# UAV-Performance-Analysis
Scientific computing to aid in the analysis of the performance of UAVs

This project has been created while participating of the university competition team UTFalcon Aerodesign as Head of Performance Analysis.

Everything was written in Python using Google Colab.

The library GSpread was used for integrating the Python script with Excel, so that there was a way to store the performance data calculated in the algorithm.
